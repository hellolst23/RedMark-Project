# **RedMark-Project**
Big Data Computing Practice Project: Epidemic Red Mark Labeling.

## **Objects**
**THE MORE ACCURATE,THE BETTER. THE FASTER, THE BETTER.**

Red-labeling of health codes based on incoming and outgoing base station data from cell phones and incoming and outgoing base station data from cell phones held by people infected with COVID-19.

## **Solutions**
### I.Accelerated computation **locally** with the python **dask library**.
#### Quick start:
In ./local:
```bash
python local_main.py
```

### II.Computing with **hadoop** and **spark distributed clusters**.
#### Cluster building.

## **Results**
